# Nexus CLI
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RiotGames/nexus_cli.png)](https://travis-ci.org/RiotGames/nexus_cli)

A CLI wrapper around Sonatype Nexus REST calls.

# Requirements

* Ruby

# Installation

1. Install the Gem - `gem install nexus_cli`
2. Create a file in your user's home directory named `.nexus_cli`
3. Give the file the following information:

```
url: 			"http://my-nexus-server/nexus/"
repository:		"my-repository-id"
username: 		"username"
password: 		"password"
```

# Usage

There are a few calls that can be made. The most important are push\_artifact and pull\_artifact. Both calls will push or pull artifacts from Nexus using the Maven Co-ordinates syntax: `groupId:artifactId:version` or `groupId:artifactId:version:extension` or `groupId:artifactId:extension:classifier:version`

One can also search for artifacts and get back raw xml containing matches.

## Pull Artifact Example

```
nexus-cli pull_artifact com.mycompany.artifacts:myartifact:1.0.0:tgz
```

## Push Artifact Example

```
nexus-cli push_artifact com.mycompany.artifacts:myartifact:1.0.0:tgz ~/path/to/file/to/push/myartifact.tgz
```

## Search Example

```
nexus-cli search_for_artifacts com.mycompany.artifacts:myartifact

or more generic if you wish:

nexus-cli search_for_artifacts com.mycompany.artifacts
```
